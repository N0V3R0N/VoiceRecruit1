        "title": "The Problem",
        "description": "In recruitment, cover letters once served as a natural filter for candidates. Why? Because writing a good letter took an hour or more. Only truly motivated candidates took the time to write one.",
        "aiImpact": "Today, with ChatGPT and AI, a cover letter can be generated in 5 minutes. Result: the natural pre-filter has disappeared.",
        "consequences": [
          "Recruiters receive hundreds of generic applications.",
